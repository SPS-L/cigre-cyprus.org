# Summary

The significance of European network codes for the connection of generators
(RfG) to the network in the evolving energy landscape, is driven by three key
factors: the rapid integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) in renewable
energy, the ongoing definition of IBR characteristics, and the influence of new
network codes on IBR attributes and grid behavior. To align it with recent
technological advancements and changes in the electric power and transport
sectors within the framework of the effort toward decarbonisation dictated a
review of the relevant provisions in the RfG. While the current structure of the
RfG Regulation remains, profound amendments as well as new articles were
introduced in the attempt to address the impacts of new developments.

Post-enactment of the technical requirements for generators, specifically IBRs,
certification entities, transmission system operators, and IBR owners must
validate IBR functionalities through compliance tests and simulations.
Compliance monitoring, crucial throughout an IBR's lifetime, involves the
commissioning and post-commissioning phases. Motivations for compliance
tests and simulations encompass establishing National Technical Specifications,
offering choices to IBR owners for selecting accredited entities, validating
compliance with compatible standards, categorizing assessments, and engaging
stakeholders with active participation from the national accreditation entity, the
Ministry, and the national commission on markets and competition.

# Speaker Bio

**Sergio Martínez Villanueva** works since 2005 for Red Eléctrica, the transmission system operator
(TSO) of the Spanish electricity system, in the Power System Reliability
Department. His key tasks in Red Eléctrica have always been related to power
system modelling and analysis and the investigation of technical requirements
for the connection of generators.

As Red Eléctrica he is also a member of the European association for the
cooperation of transmission system operators for electricity (ENTSOE) and was
part of the drafting team for the network code on requirements for the connection
of generators (EU Regulation 631/2016).
