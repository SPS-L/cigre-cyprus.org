## What to submit

The purpose of the CIGRE Cyprus National Conference is to showcase the research done in the area of Power and Energy Systems in Cyprus and create links between academia and industry. Thus, you are invited to submit anything you want (either already published, something not published, something you're about to publish, or even just a new idea you're working on). Presenting will not stop you from publishing your ideas elsewhere!

## Submission process
​
The authors need to submit a one-page summary [using this template here](../Abstract_Template.docx) through this [form](). A full paper is **not** required. The summary should cover the motivation, methodology, and application of your work.

​We'll decide whether to put you down for an oral or poster presentation based on the mix of submissions we receive but if you have a preference for an oral or poster - let us know in your email. We can't promise you'll get your request as it all depends on space - but we'll do our best to keep everyone happy.
