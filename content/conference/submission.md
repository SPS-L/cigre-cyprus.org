## You can submit anything

It can be something you've already published, something you've not published, something you're about to publish, or even just a new idea you're working on. Presenting at the Risk and Resilience Day is about showcasing your research and starting conversations. Presenting will not stop you from publishing your ideas elsewhere - we promise!

## To be a part of the Conference
​
You need to submit a one-page summary [using this template here](../Abstract_Template.docx) that describes what you will be presenting on the day. No extended abstracts or papers are required. You can include any figures or equations you need to clearly and concisely communicate your ideas. Just make sure you clearly cover:
​

- The motivation for the research.
- The unique aspects and novelty that make what you have done interesting.
- The wider applicability and value of what you have done.

​Once you have written your summary - please send it to 

​We'll decide whether to put you down for an oral or poster presentation based on the mix of submissions we receive but if you have a preference for an oral or poster - let us know in your email. We can't promise you'll get your request as it all depends on space - but we'll do our best to keep everyone happy.
