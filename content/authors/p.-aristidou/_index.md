## Short bio

Petros Aristidou got his Diploma from the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens (Greece) in 2010 and his PhD at the University of Liege (Belgium) in 2015. During his PhD, he worked on domain decomposition methods for real-time dynamic security assessment of transmission systems. He took a position as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Power Systems Laboratory at ETH Zurich (Switzerland) for one year, working on developing new control algorithms for future low-inertia power systems. Between 2016-2019 he was a Lecturer at the University of Leeds (UK), where he led the Smart Grids Lab. Since January 2020, he has been a Lecturer in Sustainable Power Systems at the Cyprus University of Technology. 

His expertise is in power system dynamics, planning, and control, and he has participated in several working groups looking into the challenges of low-inertia systems. Recent projects and publications can be found at https://sps.cut.ac.cy
