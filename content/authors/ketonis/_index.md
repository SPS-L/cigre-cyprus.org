Makis started his academic endeavours in Cyprus, where he obtained a diploma in Electrical Engineering and continued in London, where he graduated in Structural Engineering at the Willesden College of Technology and then proceeded to obtain an honors degree in Civil Engineering (B.Sc.) at the North-East London Polytechnic, London.

Prior to his engagement in renewable energies, Makis worked as a Contracts Manager with a Lagos, Nigeria, based company and was later Executive Vice-President at Wade Adams Construction overseeing the works in various countries of Africa, based in Lusaka, Zambia, completing a tenure of a total of 10 years in Africa.

Upon returning to Cyprus he became Managing Partner at PMK (Construction Management and Quantity Surveying). He later founded his own construction company Elite Constructions Ltd., where he is the Managing Director.
